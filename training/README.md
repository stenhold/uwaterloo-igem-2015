# Sandbox for math team training experiments + code

* **trainingODESystem.m** is a very simple example of coding a network in a
MATLAB ODE function, based off [code by Brian Ingalls]
(http://math.uwaterloo.ca/~bingalls/MMSB/Code/matlab/network_example.m)
* **trainingODESystem_toFill** is a fill-in-the-blanks version for
MATLAB practice
